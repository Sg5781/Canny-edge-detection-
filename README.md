Canny Edge Detection

This repository contains Python code for performing Canny edge detection on images using the OpenCV library. The Canny edge detector is a popular algorithm for detecting edges in images, developed by John F. Canny in 1986. It is widely used in various applications such as computer vision, robotics, and image processing.

Key Features:

1. Grayscale conversion

2. Gaussian blurring for noise reduction
   
3. Sobel operator for gradient calculation

4. Non-maximum suppression for edge thinning

5. Double thresholding for edge classification

6. Edge tracking by hysteresis for final edge detection
 
Dependencies:

 -Python 3.x
  OpenCV (cv2)
  NumPy
  Matplotlib
